<h1><a class="anchor" id="sec1"></a>
main idea:</h1>
<p>This project requires to write a <a class="el" href="watchdog_8cpp.html">watchdog.cpp</a> which forks itself as much as given in arguments by number N and then loads processes that's implemented in <a class="el" href="process_8cpp.html">process.cpp</a> , watchdog runs all the time in the background, it detects when a child dies via wait function. When a child dies watchdog is required to restart the process If the dead process is with id 1, wathcdog is supposed to kill all its children and restart because it is assumed that process with id 1 is a vital process and the other processes need to restart when it dies It writes all created processes with their id and pid to the named pipe to let executor know. Named pipes are used in this project in order to facilitate the communication between executor process and the watchdog, executor process reads the instructions, watchdog creates and sometimes kills processes to maintain processes' run all the time as asked for in the description. The specific directory is used for this pipe, whenever a new process is created, watchdog writes it to the pipe with its id and pid.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="sec2"></a>
bonus case:</h1>
<p>The bonus case is based around the idea that in all situations, the program should avoid orphan children and provide graceful termination. It does so by signal handler, if a SIGTERM or SIGINT signal is given, it sends kill signals to all pids on pidlist and waits for the children's termination. Then, it exits.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="sec3"></a>
conclusion:</h1>
<p>It was an educational project, I learned the inside mechanisms of what I've been learning inc cmpe322 for months. There were some points that I couldn't understand why something doesn't work as it's supposed to work. By trying alternative approaches I overcame the issues I faced. It required a calm attitude and an error-detecting approach since a problem may be caused due to various reasons. It made me use my search engine a lot.</p>
<p>At the end I provided what's asked for, my outputs are correct and I handled the bonus case too in a way that one may think of it as rather classic. However, I find this graceful termination essential, and providing it should be the action to be taken in a program like this. </p>
